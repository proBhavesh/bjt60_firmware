How to Build the Firmware (.bin file)
======================================

The .bin file isn't in the repository because it's a compiled output.
You need to build it yourself using the ARM GCC toolchain.

Step 1: Install ARM GCC Toolchain
---------------------------------
It's open source and free to download.

Windows:
  Download from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads
  Get the .exe installer for Windows (arm-gnu-toolchain-...-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe)

Linux:
  sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Mac:
  brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc

Step 2: Verify Installation
---------------------------
Open terminal/command prompt and run:
  arm-none-eabi-gcc --version

You should see version info if installed correctly.

Step 3: Build the Firmware
--------------------------
Navigate to the project folder and run:
  cd bjt60_firmware
  make clean
  make

Step 4: Find the .bin File
--------------------------
After successful build, the .bin file will be in:
  build/bjt60_presence.bin

This is the file you flash to the board.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If "make" command not found: Install make (comes with MinGW on Windows)
- If arm-none-eabi-gcc not found: Add it to your PATH environment variable
- If build fails: Make sure you have the full repository including lib/ folder
